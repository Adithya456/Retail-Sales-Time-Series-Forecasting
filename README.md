# Retail-Sales-Time-Series-Forecasting
This project forecasts retail sales using recursive time series, machine learning, and deep learning models. It examines seasonality, trends, and external factors to predict future sales. Models like ARIMA, SARIMA, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Facebook Prophet, and LSTM are compared to identify the best-performing approach.
